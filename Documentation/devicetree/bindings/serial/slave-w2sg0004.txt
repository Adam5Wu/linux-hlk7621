w2sg0004 UART-attached GPS receiver

Required properties:
- compatbile: "tty,w2sg0004"
- gpios: gpio used to toggle 'on/off' pin
- interrupts: interrupt generated by RX pin when device should
              be idle
- pinctrl: "default", "idle"
	     "idle" setting is active when device should be off.
	     This can remap the RX pin to a GPIO interrupt.

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: regulator, e.g. to power antenna


The w2sg0004 uses a pin-toggle both to power-on and to
power-off, so the driver needs to detect what state it is in.
It does this by detecting characters on the RX line.
When it should be off, these can optionally be detected by a GPIO.

The node for this device must be the child of a UART.

Example:
&uart2 {
	gps {
		compatible = "tty,w2sg0004";
		vdd-supply = <&vsim>;
		gpios = <&gpio5 17 0>; /* GPIO_145 */
		interrupts-extended = <&gpio5 19 0>; /* GPIO_147 */
		/* When idle, switch RX to be an interrupt */
		pinctrl-names = "default", "idle";
		pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_pins>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&uart2_pins_rx_gpio>;
	};
};
